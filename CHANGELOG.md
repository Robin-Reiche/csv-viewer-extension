# Changelog

All notable changes to CSV Grid Editor are documented here.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Go to Row** — New toolbar button (and `Ctrl+G` / `Cmd+G` shortcut) opens a popover where you can type any row number and jump directly to it. The target row briefly flashes blue to confirm navigation. Disabled in Paged View.
- **Duplicate Row Detection** — New toolbar button scans every row and highlights duplicates with an amber tint. A banner reports the number of duplicate rows and how many groups they form.
  - **Show only duplicates** — Filters the grid to duplicates only, sorts matching rows next to each other, and switches the `#` column to show the original CSV line number of each row so you can locate them in the source file.
  - **Dismiss** restores the full table at any time.
  - Duplicate state is automatically cleared when you edit cells, undo/redo, delete rows/columns, or the file changes externally.
  - Disabled in Paged View.
